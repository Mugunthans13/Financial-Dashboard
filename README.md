#Financial Dashboard :
    This is a financial dashboard, like a snapshot of a company's performance. It shows key
numbers such as how many things they sold, their costs, revenue, and profit. It also
breaks down the profit by different categories, like by month, day of the week, and where 
the sales came from (e.g., which country or what type of customer). This helps the company
understand where their money is coming from and where they might need to make changes.
